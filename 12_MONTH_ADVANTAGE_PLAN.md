# 12-Month Quantum Advantage: Strategic Attack Plan (REVISED)

## Executive Summary

A 12-month quantum advantage represents an unprecedented window of opportunity for a nation-state to execute a comprehensive quantum attack strategy against Bitcoin and other vulnerable systems. **CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Key breaking and fund extraction can be completely separated, allowing for maximum stealth and strategic timing. This revised plan leverages this separation to maximize value extraction while minimizing detection risk.

## Strategic Paradigm Shift: Separation of Key Breaking and Extraction

### Key Strategic Insight
**Breaking private keys and stealing funds are two completely separate operations that can be executed independently:**

1. **Key Breaking Phase**: Use quantum computer to derive private keys from public keys
2. **Fund Extraction Phase**: Use derived private keys to sign transactions and steal funds

### Timeline Implications
- **Months 1-9**: Break as many high-value private keys as possible
- **Months 10-12**: Execute coordinated fund extraction across all compromised addresses
- **Post-advantage**: Continue extraction even after rivals develop quantum capability

## Phase 1: Key Breaking Marathon (Months 1-9)
