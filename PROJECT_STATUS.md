The Bitcoin Quantum Vulnerability Scanner project has completed its initial setup and first subproject implementation.

## Completed Components

### âœ… Repository Setup
- [x] Project structure and organization
- [x] Comprehensive `.gitignore` file
- [x] Environment configuration management
- [x] Documentation and README files
- [x] Setup and utility scripts

### âœ… Core Infrastructure
- [x] Configuration management (`utils/config.py`)
- [x] Database utilities (`utils/database.py`)
- [x] Bitcoin RPC client (`p2pk_scanner/bitcoin_rpc.py`)
- [x] PostgreSQL database schema
- [x] Virtual environment setup

### âœ… P2PK Scanner (Phase 1)
- [x] P2PK address identification logic
- [x] Blockchain scanning engine
- [x] Database storage and tracking
- [x] Progress tracking and resumption
- [x] Comprehensive logging
- [x] Test suite and validation
- [x] Setup and reset scripts
- [x] Documentation and usage guides

## Current Capabilities

The P2PK scanner can:
- âœ… Connect to Bitcoin Core via RPC
- âœ… Connect to PostgreSQL database
- âœ… Scan blockchain blocks for P2PK addresses
- âœ… Identify and extract public keys from P2PK scripts
- âœ… Store addresses and transactions in database
- âœ… Resume scanning from interruption point
- âœ… Provide progress updates and statistics
- âœ… Handle errors gracefully and continue scanning

## Database Schema

### p2pk_addresses
- Stores identified P2PK addresses
- Tracks first/last seen blocks
- Records total received and current balances
- Links to transaction history

### p2pk_transactions
- Records all P2PK-related transactions
- Tracks block height and timestamps
- Links to address records

### scan_progress
- Tracks scanning progress across subprojects
- Enables resumption after interruption

## Performance Metrics

- **Scan Speed**: ~1000 blocks per batch (configurable)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal, processes blocks sequentially
- **Database**: Optimized with indexes for fast queries
- **Resilience**: Continues scanning even if individual blocks fail
